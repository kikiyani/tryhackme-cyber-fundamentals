***INTRODUCTION TO OFFENSIVE SECURITY***
In this room, i learnt what offensive security is: When you test the systems by ethically hacking them, so basically looking for vulnerabilities in the system. 
I deployed the virtual machine and using GOBUSTER i found the hidden pages of the bank website provided, and accessed the website using one of the hidden pages, and transferred money to myself and earned a flag. It was a very good experiance to hack my first website and see how hacking and red teaming operates. 

***INTRODUCTION TO DEFENSIVE SECURITY***
In this room, i was introduced to defensive side of cyber security. I learnt about SOC, DFIR ( digital forensics incident response ) which included malware analysis, threat detection and details of blue teaming: network monitoring, log analysis and acting like an investigator. 
I was asked to access this site where we used SIEM system to figure out the potential threat we see and report it and find out details about the IP address. It was also a great learning experiance on how the blue team operates. 

***LINUX FUNDAMENTALS***
In this room i was introduced with linux and deployed the virtual machine. 
I was introduced with basic commands: echo, whoami
i played around with filesystem: ls, cd , cat, pwd
Also worked with commands like: find (syntax: find -name *.txt or find -name file.txt ),, grep 
was introduced to shell operators: &( for commands to run in background ), && ( commands to execute together ), >> ( to write at the bottom of file ), > ( to overwrite into a file )
