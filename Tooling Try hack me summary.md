***Nmap Live Host Discovery***
This room was a detailed explanation on how NMAP (network mapper) finds online systems/hosts on a network before starting the port scanning, since doing the port scanning on offline system is time wastage. To discover live hosts nmap can take these approaches:
ARP scan, ICMP scan, TCP/ UDP
TASK 1: i was given two subnets joined through 1 router and was asked to broadcast an ARP requestion of finding the computer 6. I learnt alot about subnetting here and how ARP requests are managed in subnetting.
TASK 2: It was enumerating targets using nmap, how we can tell nmap to scan what targets. Using the attack machine, i explored few nmap commands and answered the task questions.
TASK 3: I tackled with ARP request and respons ealong with ICMP ping packets between two subnets. 
TASK4:
